# AtliQo Bank - A/B Test Analysis (Phase 2)

This project is a statistical analysis of an A/B test campaign conducted by AtliQo Bank. It serves as Phase 2, following the initial target market identification (18-25 age group) from Phase 1.

## Objective

The objective of this analysis is to statistically determine if the new credit card, which was marketed to the target "test group," successfully **increased their average transaction amount** compared to the "control group".

## Methodology: Hypothesis Testing

A one-tailed z-test for two independent samples was used to compare the means of the two groups.

* **Null Hypothesis ($H_0$):** The average transaction amount of the test group is less than or equal to the average transaction amount of the control group.
* **Alternative Hypothesis ($H_1$):** The average transaction amount of the test group is *greater than* the average transaction amount of the control group.
* **Significance Level ($\alpha$):** 0.05 (or 5%).

## Data

The analysis uses the `avg_transactions_after_campaign.csv` file, which contains the daily average transaction amounts for both the control group and the test group (the 18-25 age market) after the campaign launch.

## Results & Conclusion

The `statsmodels.stats.ztest` was performed to get the test statistic and p-value.

* **Z-statistic:** 2.748
* **P-value:** 0.00299

**Conclusion: Reject the Null Hypothesis.**

Since the **p-value (0.00299) is less than the significance level (0.05)**, we reject the null hypothesis. The results are statistically significant, and we can conclude that the marketing campaign for the new credit card **successfully increased the average transaction amount** for the 18-25 age group.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Pandas:** For data loading and manipulation.
* **Statsmodels:** For performing the one-tailed z-test.
* **Matplotlib / Seaborn:** For visualizing the distributions of the results.

## How to Run This Project

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas statsmodels matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab
    ```
3.  Ensure the `avg_transactions_after_campaign.csv` data file is in the same directory as the notebook.
4.  Run the `Testing for new Credit Card.ipynb` file using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
